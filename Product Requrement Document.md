# GHG Reporting Platform

---
# 1. Product Overview

## One-Line Positioning

**A professional-grade GHG reporting platform designed for reliability, auditability, and regulatory confidence.**

---

## Product Vision

To become the trusted infrastructure for organizations that require defensible, verification-grade greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting.

The platform prioritizes **data reliability, auditability, and regulatory alignment** over speed or simplicity, supporting organizations where emissions data has legal, financial, or reputational impact.

---

## Core Product Pillars

### 1) Data Reliability (Non-Negotiable Accuracy)

The platform is built for organizations where data accuracy and defensibility are mission-critical.

- Validated inputs over estimates  
- Traceable data sources  
- Transparent calculation logic  
- Reproducible results  

This is not a lightweight estimation tool, but a system for producing verification-grade emissions data.

---

### 2) Professional Audit Trails

Every data point, change, and calculation is:

- Time-stamped  
- Attributable to a user  
- Historically reconstructable  
- Methodology-linked  

The system must answer:

- What was reported on date X?  
- Who changed what and when?  
- Which emission factor/version was used?  
- What assumptions were active then?

---

### 3) Up-to-Date Authority Data

The platform continuously aligns with:

- Latest emission factor datasets  
- Regulatory frameworks  
- Methodological guidance  

Key principles:

- Versioned emission factors  
- Regulatory update tracking  
- Historical consistency for audits  

---

### 4) Built with Sustainability Professionals

Product decisions are guided by professional sustainability managers.

This ensures:

- Realistic workflows  
- Methodological rigor  
- Regulatory awareness  
- Practitioner-grade usability  

---

# 4. Problem Statement

Organizations increasingly rely on GHG data for:

- Regulatory compliance  
- Investor reporting  
- Value chain requirements  
- Public disclosures  

However, the current market fails to serve organizations that need both **reliability and practicality**.

Most existing solutions fall into one of the following categories:

---
### Too Generic
Broad ESG platforms often prioritize dashboards and high-level reporting over audit defensibility.  
They lack deep audit trails, methodology transparency, and versioned data controls required for verification-grade reporting.

---
### Too Simplistic
Lightweight SMB carbon calculators focus on speed and simplicity but lack defensibility.  
They are suitable for rough estimates but not for audit-ready or regulatory-grade reporting.

---
### Too Expensive
Reliable, audit-grade platforms are often priced for large enterprises only.  
This makes them inaccessible for smaller or mid-sized organizations that still require high-quality reporting.
Organizations are forced to choose between:
- Affordability and reliability  
- Simplicity and defensibility  

---
### Too Rigid
Many platforms enforce fixed methodologies and calculation structures.  
Organizations cannot:
- Apply different methodologies to different scopes or categories  
- Adapt to sector-specific practices  
- Reflect evolving regulatory expectations  

This rigidity reduces real-world applicability and creates audit risks.

---
### Too Dependent on Experts
Some tools require deep methodological expertise to operate correctly.  
Users become highly dependent on consultants or specialists to:
- Configure calculations  
- Interpret standards  
- Prepare audit documentation  
This increases cost, slows reporting cycles, and creates knowledge silos.

---
## Resulting Challenges
These limitations lead to:
- Audit failures  
- Rework and remediation costs  
- Overreliance on consultants  
- Compliance risks  
- Low trust in reported data  
- Limited scalability across organization sizes  
---
## Opportunity
There is a clear need for a platform that delivers:
- Professional-grade reliability  
- Built-in auditability  
- Methodological flexibility  
- Reduced expert dependency  
- Scalable pricing aligned with organizational complexity  
A solution that treats GHG reporting as compliance-grade data infrastructure rather than a lightweight reporting exercise.
